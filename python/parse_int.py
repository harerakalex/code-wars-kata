'''
In this kata we want to convert a string into an integer. The strings simply represent the numbers in words.

Examples:

"one" => 1
"twenty" => 20
"two hundred forty-six" => 246
"seven hundred eighty-three thousand nine hundred and nineteen" => 783919
Additional Notes:

The minimum number is "zero" (inclusively)
The maximum number, which must be supported is 1 million (inclusively)
The "and" in e.g. "one hundred and twenty-four" is optional, in some cases it's present and in others it's not
All tested numbers are valid, you don't need to validate them

    # Hard code numbers, use Pythonâ€™s enumerate() to get a counter and the value from the iterable at the same time!
    
    words = {w: n for n, w in enumerate('zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen'.split())}
    words.update({w: 10 * n for n, w in enumerate('twenty thirty forty fifty sixty seventy eighty ninety hundred'.split(), 2)})
    thousands = {w: 1000 ** n for n, w in enumerate('thousand million billion trillion quadrillion quintillion sextillion septillion octillion nonillion decillion'.split(), 1)}

    num = group = 0
    for word in strng.replace(' and ', ' ').replace('-', ' ').split():
        if word == 'hundred': group *= words[word]
        elif word in words: group += words[word]
        else:
            num += group * thousands[word]
            group = 0
            
    return num + group
